## About my knowledge of Cloud Technologies

To be honest this is my first task and experience in this major. I used to work with docker before but it was for the fist time to work with Terraform.
I have spent several hours to understand and how to use Terraform. But I am sure that this topic is really interesting and I would love to learn about it more
